## Features / Highlights
## • Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to understand:

  • What is the overall attrition rate?

  • Which departments have the highest employee turnover?

  • Is attrition influenced by age or gender?

  • How does job satisfaction relate to employee retention?

  • Which education fields experience higher turnover?

Raw HR spreadsheets do not provide quick strategic insights.

## • Goal of the Dashboard

To design an interactive HR intelligence tool that:

  • Tracks employee count and attrition metrics

  • Identifies high-risk departments and age groups

  • Analyzes job satisfaction trends

  • Evaluates gender-based attrition patterns

Supports HR strategy and workforce planning
